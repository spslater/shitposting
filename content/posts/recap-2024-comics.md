As I said in the [previous post]({{< relref "recap-2024-books" >}}), I've also
started reading comic books again. I stopped around 2020 when I moved, but
hadn't really stopped buying the floopies so I have a massive 4 year backlog of
books. Some of them I'm going to just jump to something more current (Batman,
Detective Comics, Wonder Woman) while some I have a lot of catching up to do
(Nightwing, Miles Morales). I had a brief spurt during the early part of the
year (May and June ish) where I was reading a couple and had sorted my floopies
by book and into boxes of what I wanted to read. But then summer came and work
got busy so I stopped reading. Picked back up again around October and have been
getting thru at least a couple issues a week (which isn't enough to eat away at
the backlog).

## Reviews-ish
### Energon Universe
Throughout the year, the *Energon Universe* books were what I looked forward to
week to week, even though I wasn't keeping up with the reading. I've enjoyed
Robert Kirkman's writing previously on *Invincible* and *Fire Power*, so it was
an easy decision to pick up *Void Rivals*. Of the limited series I liked
*Scarlett* the best, Kelly Thompson is another writer that I've enjoyed what I
read of hers. I also liked Marco Ferrari's art on it. *Void Rivals* and
*Transformers* have also been very fun to read. Though I'm not 100% sold on the
art in *Transformers*, it gets a bit too busy for my liking. Jury's still out on
*G.I. Joe*, have only read the first issue and I'm enjoying it enough to
continue. I have no real prior history with *Transformers* and *G.I. Joe* so I
don't get any fan-service-y things the books may do, I'm just enjoying the ride.

### Other Non DC / Marvel Books
When I saw that *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* was doing a soft reboot, I
figured it was as good a time as any to jump on, I'd read Vols 1 and 2 of the
previous run and really enjoyed them, but I had them as trades and so just fell
behind on them. I had read the two Jennika volumes they collected and loved
those and wanted more. 5 issues into this run and I'm really enjoying it. The
art being different for each turtle is really neat. I'm curious to see where the
stroy goes with the second arc.

I follow Kieron Gillen on Bluesky and had seen him talk about *The Power
Fantasy* for a couple months. It wasn't until issue 4 that I semi-impulsively
grabbed the the books all at once from my local shop. Luckily they still had
copies of the first 4 or I don't think I would've picked it up. And thankfully I
did! I don't know if I've fallen in love with a book faster. Caspar Wijngaard's
art is phenomenonal, I'm going to have to find more work by him.

I picked *Undiscovered Country* up when it started it's run, one of those
weirdly poorly timed books about a global pandemic releasing a few months before
a real global pandemic. But I mostly enjoyed the story, it's been a little hard
following it issue to issue and in spurts the way I've read it. Sounds like
there's currently 36 issues, so we're 6 issues from the end, but haven't seen
anything since issue 30 in July. It may sound like faint praise but I think it's
a decent enough book to pick up and read. Not rush it to the top of the stack,
but enough to add it at least. 

*Fire Power* is a book I really enjoyed and was sad it ended. Chris Samnee's art
was what brought me to the book in the first place and Kirkman's writing was
nice icing on the cake. I felt the ending was rushed a little bit and wasn't
100% satisfied with the epilogue but overall the story is good enough to make up
for that.

*Jonna and the Unpossible Monsters* was a really fun quick series. I really
appreciate books that are around 12 issues. I think it may be close to the ideal
length of a series. Another book drawn by Chris Samnee, another book with
gorgeous art. The writing for it was really fun, I thoroughly enjoyed the
relationship between the sisters.

### Marvel Books
I always think of myself as someone who reads like half Marvel half DC books,
but whenever I look at my lists it's like 80% DC. Nothing makes this more
evident than me only having finished / caught up on 2 Marvel books and am
working on catching up on a 3rd. 

*Hawkeye: Kate Bishop* was a fun miniseries. Kate Bishop is a fun character and
I wish she'd get more books, but alas, other people don't agree with my correct
opinions. Confining the story to a chateau was really cool and felt like a good
way to keep the story confined. I read *Ms. Marvel: Beyond the Limit* early in
the year (along with *Hakeye*) and just really don't remember much from it. But
I do remember that I enjoyed it and it made me want more Ms. Marvel (as always).
I'm glad I have 2 more miniseries of hers and then NYX to read.

The last Marvel book I've been reading (so far this year) is *New Mutants*. I
usually gravitate towards the teen / young adult team up books because they
generally lean towards non world ending threats. I enjoyed the book a bit better
in the earlier issues of the run. The latest arc I read was Illyana giving
Madelyne the throne of Limbo and enjoyed it but the cast really just being
Magik, Mirage, and Wolfsbane was a bit smaller than what I want from the book.
I'm still looking forward to wrapping up the book and seeing where the
characters end up (if they are able to do it cleanly). I always want to read
more X-Men books but end up just not latching onto any. I had dropped the main
X-Men book earlier so once this is done, NYX will be the only I have and I'm
reading that because of Ms. Marvel.

### DC Books
First the books I didn't really care for the *Shadow War* and *Lazarus Planet*
crossovers. I am just very very tired of crossovers at this point, there are too
many of them. I skimmed thru *Batman vs Robin* for a similar reason, I was just
tired from the Lazarus Island stuff. I felt the ending to Robin was good and
didn't need to continue.

A pseudo-crossover I did enjoy was Robins and that's mostly because it left the
other books alone. It didn't require me to read a couple of random issues for
other books and you just needed to read issues 1 to 6 to get the whole story.
I'm curious to see if Jenny Wren gets pulled into the wider Batman mythos or if
she just remains confined to this story. I really like when all of the Robins
get together and interact. *Batman: Wayne Family Adventures* on Webtoons is
another story where the Batfam acts like an actual family and I really love when
those dynamics are explored.

I've only read the first 2 issues of *Batman The Long Halloween: The Last
Halloween* and am just kind of confused mostly because I haven't read the
*Batman: The Long Halloween Special* and barely remember what happened in *The
Long Halloween*. I may but the book on hold until I get around to reading
*Batman: The Long Halloween Special* just to help things make more sense.
*Batman / Catwoman* was a really good book. I like the couple of Black Label
books I've read that get to explore some part of a character. I really liked the
3 timeline aspect of the book. 

*Dark Knights of Steel* is one of my favorite books in a long while. I really
love these wild alternate takes on characters, plopping them down in a different
setting. Marvel 1602 is another one book with a similar pitch that I've been
wanting to check out for a while. Yasmine Putri's art was beautiful thru the
whole series and really enhanced Tom Taylor's writing. I thought they did the
twists and reveals pretty well. I'm not always great at picking up on them, but
was impressed and enjoyed where they went with it. I'm really excited to read
*Dark Knights of Steel: Allwinter* and the *Tales from the Three Kingdoms*.

*Zatanna: Bring Down the House* was another of the Black Label books that I've
enjoyed. I haven't read much of her character but am always excited when she
appears in movies and shows, so I made sure to pick this book up when I saw it.
I really loved the art in this one, thought it played with the comics medium in
a fun way.

*Jenny Sparks* was a book I picked up on a whim and was pretty impressed by. I'm
not familiar with the character's Wildstorm backstory. It's a neat "punching
won't solve the problem" story and think her annoyed-at-everyone attitude is
enjoyable so far.

*My Adventures with Superman* is one of my favorite tv shows of recent and the
book has become one of my favorite tie-ins for the show. I enjoyed the *Young
Justice* books they've put out were good as well so thought this would also be a
good bet to pick up. The characters feel true to their show portrayals and I'm
hoping there will be more than just the single arc.

*Absolute Batman* and *Absolute Wonder Woman* have been a cool new take on the
characters so far. I think Bruce being friends with the rogues and just a
working class dude who has done all the jobs while Alfred is working for some
weird shady government organization is fun and doesn't stray far from the
characters core. Same can be said of Wonder Woman growing up with Circe and
learning magic from her. Plus riding Pegasus that is all bones and having a
massive sword is really dope. Kelly Thompson's writing is always a joy for me so
I'm looking forward to more *Absolute Wonder Woman*.
