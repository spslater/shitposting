+++

As I said in the [previous post]({{< relref "recap-2024-books" >}}), I've also started reading comic books again. I stopped around 2020 when I moved, but hadn't really stopped buying the floopies so I have a massive 4 year backlog of books. Some of them I'm going to just jump to something more current (Batman, Detective Comics, Wonder Woman) while some I have a lot of catching up to do (Nightwing, Miles Morales).

Books:
- Cobra Commander
- Dark Knights of Steel
- Duke
- Undiscovered Country
- Robins
- Shadow War (crossover)
- Destro
- Scarlett
- Zatanna: Bring Down the House
- Transformers
- GI Joe
- Absolute Batman
- Absolute Wonder Woman
- Void Rivals
- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
- Batman vs Robin
- The Power Fantasy
- Batman / Catwoman
- Jenny Sparks
- My Adventures with Superman
- Batman - The Long Halloween - The Last Halloween
