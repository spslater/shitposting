What is going on here? Why have I grouped all of video into 1 recap? Because I
didn't want to write too many recaps and some of the categories didn't feel like
they deserved a full post.

## YouTube
### Top Channels
1. Milo Rossi (Miniminuteman)
2. Angela Collier
3. Any Austin
4. Secret Base
5. RobWords
6. Cambrian Chronicles
7. Cracking The Cryptic
8. Hank Green (hankschannel)
9. Jay Foreman
10. Jomboy Media

I had decided to watch less YouTube this year. I used to check my Subscriptions
feed every day but felt like I was wasting too much time on videos that I just
wasn't super interested in and was just watching because they were there. I've
started watching a bit more frequently as the end of the year has approached,
there is a few channels I will check when I see social media updates or, in the
case of Jomboy Media, a video is recommended (either algorithmically or thru a
friend). His is the only channel in my Top 10 I'm not subscribed to.

This has led to some weird behavior like not having watched a *Cracking the
Cryptic* video since the beginning of April or binging *Any Austin* and
*Cambrian Chronicles* videos in a short period. Beginning of the year I am
planning on going thru my subscription list and purging a bunch of old subs and
just curating it to be a useful feed again. I'm hoping to be able to use it less
destructively next year. 

My "Watch later" list has been the defining experience of YouTube for me this
year. I had about 100 videos on it and really wanted to get thru it. I've got it
down to hover around 30 for a while now, with some videos requiring me to do
some homework before watching and other just needing to set aside an hour or
two. This has led me to not watching videos from some of the essay channels I'd
like to watch such as *Accented Cinema*, *Five by Five Takes*, and particularly
*Sage's Rain*. I also need to catch up on like 2 years worth of *Noclip*
documentaries.

### Top Videos (ish)
I hadn't been keeping track of my favorites from the year and I don't regularly
add videos to my Favorites playlist. I've only added 11 this year which isn't a
lot compared to the number of videos I have watched. I also basically never like
a video.

The useful to know ones from that list (ordered by added to list, newest first,
earlier in the year last):

|     23 | Star Trek: Lower Decks      |      5 | Dec 19 |

\* D20 seasons are shows on Dimension 20, it may be like "Season 26" but since
it's an anthology show, it's weird putting that. *Fantasy High: Junior Year* is
season 3 of the *Fantasy High* setting, *Misfits & Magic Season 2* is self
explanatory, and *Never Stop Blowing Up* is the first and only season of that
setting so far.

### Currently Watching
1. Adventuring Academy (S5)
2. Dirty Laundry (S4)
3. Gastronauts (S1)
4. Jentry Chau vs the Underworld (S1)
5. Make Some Noise (S3)
6. Nobody Asked (S1)
7. Skeleton Crew (S1)
8. Star Wars Rebels (S3)
9. Time Quangle [Dimension 20]
10. Very Important People (S2)

It's taking me "so long" for Rebels season 3 because I'm watching along with the
[A More Civilized Age](https://amorecivilizedage.net/) podcast and they took a
couple month break covering the season while one of the hosts wasn't able to
participate. The other shows are currently airing (Jentry Chau just released a
couple weeks ago on Netflix).

### Top 10 Favorite Shows This Year
1. Dimension 20 (all the seasons, I can't pick)
2. Star Trek: Lower Decks
3. My Adventures with Superman
4. Arcane
5. Game Changer
6. Strange New Worlds
7. Star Wars Rebels
8. Very Important People
9. Reacher
10. Smartypants

I am just in love with *Dimension 20*, I really enjoy the "short" seasons
(compared to Critical Role) and think they do an excellent job editing the show
and making the stage look awesome.

*Lower Decks* is possibly may favorite Star Trek but I haven't watched the older
stuff in the past few of years. I felt like the last season was just getting
going when they were on the penultimate episode and it's a big shame that it
ended with this season. I rarely got the references they were making but still
found it very funny. The show really felt like it understood the joy present in
idea of the world.

*My Adventures with Superman* is one of my favorite DC cartoons and could
possibly rival *Young Justice* and *Teen Titans* depending on how long it runs.
The relationship between Lois and Clark and the fact they kicked it off right
away really makes the show sing.

*Arcane* was just as beautiful as the first season and that helped carry it thru
some rougher story telling. Despite that, I really enjoyed it overall and would
like to see them do more shows in this universe and style. 

*Strange New Worlds* took me a bit to get around to after watching the backdoor
pilot on *Discovery* and I wish I'd had jumped on board sooner though the wait
between the first and second season would've been awful (like the wait for the
third is now). I love all the characters on the ship and think they have
established great dynamics between them.

*Star Wars Rebels* has been made very enjoyable by listening to [A More
Civilized Age's](https://amorecivilizedage.net/) coverage of it. I probably
would've liked it anyway but their insights into the show and catching things I
wouldn't have thought about makes it that much better. I think the crew of the
Ghost is a great cast and wish Disney would've understood why it's so good and
carried that into the movies and other shows.

*Reacher* was a semi-impulsive watch after hearing a couple people talk about
how surprisingly good it was. I binged both seasons in like 2 weeks and just
instantly fell in love. I had enjoyed Alan Ritchson on *Blue Mountain State* and
*Titans* prior to watching *Reacher* so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. At
first I'd wished we'd gotten more of the characters from season 1 in season 2
but then I had such a blast with the season 2 characters.

*Game Changer*, *Very Important People*, and *Smartypants* are my 3 favorite
shows on Dropout TV right now. Dropout is the only platform I check every day
for the new episode of whatever show and watch every episode of every show on
there (eventually). I think these 3 shows really show the strength of the
talented cast the service has (outside of D20 which I already talked about).

### Looking Forward To
- more Dimension 20
- The Dragon Prince (S4)
- Rebels (S4) and beyond
- Scavengers Reign (S1)
- Strange New Worlds (S3)

I had just missed the release of season 4 of *The Dragon Prince* and then kept
putting it off but now that the show has released it's final season, I think
I'll end up binging everything pretty quickly. I had been told by my friends
that I really need to watch *Scavengers Reign* because it's amazing so it'll be
the next thing I start once a few of my current shows end. The other shows on
that list are seasons after ones I've talked about above.


## Movies
I only watched 8 movies this year and they just so happen to be in order from
best to worst (ish, Akira is better than *Deadpool* and *Spider-Man*). Though
*Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* is only listed 3rd because I've seen it
before and hadn't seen the first 2. This was also rewatching Akira because my
friends hadn't seen it before (somehow...). I also watched the *Mobile Suit
Gundam* recap movies, but forget when I actually watched them, they are above
*Deadpool* below *Spider-Man* on my list.
| &nbsp; | Movie                                             | Year | Date   |
| -----: | :---                                              | ---: | ---:   |
|      1 | Dune: Part Two                                    | 2024 | Mar 09 |
|      2 | Baby Assassins                                    | 2021 | May 14 |
|      3 | Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse               | 2023 | Jul 16 |
|      4 | Deadpool & Wolverine                              | 2024 | Jul 28 |
|      5 | Akira [sub]                                       | 1988 | Nov 15 |
|        | Mobile Suit Gundam [sub]                          | 1981 |        |
|        | Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow [sub]   | 1981 |        |
|        | Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space [sub] | 1982 |        |

I really want to finally get around to watching *John Wick: Chapter 4* (2023)
and *Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga* (2024) because I love both the series they came
from and just missed them in the theater. I would like to get back to my watch
thru of the Godzilla movies in release order with *Ghidorah, the Three-Headed
Monster* (1964) and continue with my Gundam watch thru of every one of the those
shows and movies.
