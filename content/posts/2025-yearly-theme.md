I am easily convinced to try and do new things to make my life easier though I
rarely follow thru on them or realize that it just doesn't work (like
[Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/)). However I really liked CGP Grey's
[Your Theme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) video and think of it more
frequently than just at the New Year. I have usually come up with some Theme
each year, but never write it down or follow thru with it. I've thought of
getting the [Theme System Journal](https://www.themesystem.com/) but also know
that I would fall off using it after a week or two. I'm hoping that if I type up
what my yearly theme is, I'll both be more likely to remember what I want to do
and stay committed to it throughout the year.

## Year of Resume
This year I want to pick back up projects and hobbies that I used to enjoy
working on but have dropped for a long-ish period of time. Some of these have
been on hold for *years* while others have been since mid last year. I have 3
sections that I want focus on: programming, "house things", and entertainment. 

### Programming
I've had multiple pieces of software that've I've developed to a semi-functional
point, but there are many things I want to expand on with them. I managed to
update [BorgAPI](https://github.com/spslater/borgapi) in January and get it
caught up with current compatibility for the BorgBackup software it's wrapping
(at least I believe I did).
[Batch Rename Program](https://github.com/spslater/batchrenameprogram) does
everything I need it to right now and just has some QoL changes I'd like to
make; this one feels like it'd be the easiest to pick back up and continue with
off and on. [PPF Checklist](https://github.com/spslater/ppfchecklist) needs some
small updates to use a production web server instead of the builtin Flask dev
server. [todo ledger](https://github.com/spslater/todoledger) has much work to
be done to make it more useable.
[SPATS](https://github.com/orgs/spatsapp/repositories) is the "biggest" / most
ambitious software I've been working. I've had the idea for it rattling around
in my head for almost a decade. I haven't touched it in about 4 years and have
plans to do major technical overhauls I want to do for the backend and frontend
(with some possibility of even making it just one repository instead of two).

### House Things
Sort of related to the programing, the first two things I want to resume working
on is digitizing our physical pictures (and sort of cleaning up our existing
digital ones) and competent backup mechanisms (which will be powered by
BorgAPI). I also bought a 3D Printer on sale summer of last year but was too
busy to set it up for a while and then was struggling with getting it calibrated
so I've never printed anything with it yet. The last thing is an easy-ish thing
and also more complicated. I've been working on making a proper electrical
circuit map of the house since our breaker isn't super accurate. With that new
map I want to develop a plan for wiring our house for ethernet (which is the
more complicated part). 

### Entertainment
#### Reading
I used to be a voracious reader but have basically fallen off of prose
completely (reading 7 books since 2020). My comic book reading was much more
frequent keeping up with my weekly books until COVID hit and then I fell off
hard and now have a year plus backlog. Last year I managed to get thru the Star
Wars Thrawn Trilogy and am listening to Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books now.
I have some non-fiction this year as well. If I can read 4 books this year, I'll
be happy (counting the Earthsea books as 1). I am also hoping to catch up on a
couple Newsletters / Publications that I've been enjoying but fell off late last
year ([Crossplay](https://www.crossplay.news),
[Garbage Day](https://garbageday.substack.com/),
[Bret Devereaux's Blog](https://acoup.blog/), and
[Remap's writing](https://remapradio.com/)). 

#### Writing
I had a journal I was writing infrequent thoughts in for the media I was reading
/ watching / playing and I'd like to make that a bit more frequent, especially
as I work on doing more stuff. I am constantly thinking of new table top games
and not really writing them down in a coherent way. I want to figure out a way
to store the ideas in a better fashion than just random text documents. I have a
few that I want to focus on first-ish. One of those RPGs also has a story for
some characters I'd been writing and want to pick that back up.

#### Video
##### YouTube
I also used to keep up on a good number of YouTube channels that I've fallen off
of mostly because I stepped back from YouTube for taking too much of my time.
I've paired down my subscription list so I think I'll be able to waste less time
on it if I *just* look at the Subscriptions tab. Particularly want to catch up
on [Angela Collier](https://www.youtube.com/@acollierastro),
[Artifexian](https://www.youtube.com/@Artifexian),
[Noclip](https://www.youtube.com/@NoclipDocs),
[Secret Base](https://www.youtube.com/@SecretBaseSBN),
[SovietWomble](https://www.youtube.com/@SovietWomble), and
[Summoning Salt](https://www.youtube.com/@SummoningSalt) among some specific
videos here and there on other channels. 

##### Movies, TV, and Anime
I had begun on working thru some series and got sidetracked / just dropped when
COVID happened (that really thru most hobbies in a loop for me). I got the
Criterion collection of the
[Showa-Era Godzilla films](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/2648-godzilla-the-showa-era-films-1954-1975)
and got thru the first 4 movies and want to work thru the next 11 plus the modern
American and Japanese ones (2014 +). I've also started working thru the Ghibli
movies chronologically since I've got big gaps in those movies. The other big
project I had been working on is watching *every* Gundam show / movie anime
made and listening along with [Mobile Suit Breakdown](https://gundampodcast.com/).
I got thru the original show and the three recap movies. Now I need to watch
*Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam*.
