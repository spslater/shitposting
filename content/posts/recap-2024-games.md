I don't play as many video games as I'd like to, especially with how much I
think about them. Getting the Steam Deck last year really helped me play more
during work downtime and I'm super happy with that purchase. Most of the games I
get are smaller indie games that don't have super long hour counts, at least to
get to points where I'd feel happy saying I "completed" / "beat" the game. I
never had the desire to 100% games and just getting to credits is accomplishment
enough. Though, I also rarely get to credits on games and not just because I
play lots of open ended sim games. I've gotten to the very last level of *Ape
Out*, couldn't beat it, and still consider it one of my favorite games of all
time. My current "on the last level" game is *Hades* and really wanted to beat
it this year, especially before *Hades 2* releases, but I've only made 2 run
attempts all year. So what follows is the list of every game I've played this
year for some meaningful amount of time (more than like 10 mins or so). Of the
the games that I own but haven't played yet, *Neva* is really the only one I am
super looking forward to. I adore Nomada's previous game *Gris* so I bought
*Neva* day it was released. I had intentions of streaming it for my friends but
there just wasn't a good time where we had the 4 or 5 hours to play thru it. So
I've given up on that for right now and just need to find that time to be able
to do in one sitting because I know I'll hate having to put it down.

## Don't Like
Just to get the downers out of the way quickly. I've tried these games, probably
haven't even put in an hour into any single game, but they just weren't grabbing
me. 
- Deadlock
- Marvel Rivals
- Absolute Drift
- Parcel Corps Demo

### *Deadlock* and *Marvel Rivals*
I think I just have to admit to myself that I'm bad at shooters. Everyone gets
too competitive too quickly for multiplayer games and that's all these types of
games have to offer. I still occasionally play *Overwatch 2* with my friends and
some of us have played *Marvel Rivals* together, but I just don't have the
bandwidth to learn new heroes and new abilities at the rate I play with them. 

### *Absolute Drift*
The technical skill for this to get the turning *just right* is too difficult
for me. It's a beautiful game and I think really well designed, it's just not
for me.

### *Parcel Corps* demo
I think I'm going to have to give this a second shot, the setup I was playing
this game with was a little awkward and caused some lag issues. I just struggled
with maneuvering the bike around without getting frustrated. I like the concept
of the game and the pitch sounded like something I'd really enjoy but sadly it
wasn't for me.

## Most Played (and therefore my favorites)
- AdVenture Communist
- art of rally
- Timberborn
- Coffee Golf
- Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders Demo

### *AdVenture Communist*
This is a mobile clicker game that I would probably find unplayable, except for
the fact that my ad blocker happens to work for the in-game ads and it just
gives me the bonus without having watched whatever ad it wanted me to.
Thankfully it doesn't make progress so difficult that you have to buy the
boosts, of which there are plenty for sale. The game is the perfect right after
waking up and right before bed game to just pop open and click the little
buttons for like 5 mins.

### *art of rally*
A gorgeous rally racing game, taking place in the "alternate world" where Group
B racing was never banned. The difficulty is just easy enough that I'm able to
compete moderately well against the CPUs and still progress. I find most
enjoyment from the game by just competing against myself and seeing my skill at
controlling the cars get better as I race more. Each race is also the perfect
length that I can play in short sessions which is ideal for work.

### *Timberborn*
Outside of probably *AdVenture Communist*, I haven't put more hours into any
other game this year and I definitely haven't put more hours per session; I've
played a bit more than 50 hours. This is a city builder game where your workers
and citizens are beavers building their colony. The game has been in early
access for 3 years so far, and I played soon after the Badwater update was
released at the beginning of the year. I really loved the beaver theming of it
and thought they did a good job theming buildings and jobs around that. I played
on an easier difficulty just because I find the enjoyment in these games about
designing the cities and not so much from resource management. I probably won't
play this game much (if at all) until it's 1.0 release but am eagerly looking
forward to it.


### *Coffee Golf*
The only other mobile game I regularly play, this mini-golf game has perfect
bite sized daily courses with no par limit. I enjoy doing my best to try and get
a "Top 10%" ranking. My biggest gripe with the game is it has a daily streak,
and sometimes I just forget to play or think I did and ended up not. I get
really really discouraged when I see a streak end, had one that was around 65
and just stopped playing the game for a week after it broke. I got it back up to
20ish and then broke it and haven't played in a month. I'll probably pick it
back up after the new year and just do my best to purposefully break the streak
so I don't get that discouragement again. They also have regular levels mode
that just goes up in difficulty but those have stroke limits and I find less
fun.


### *Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders* demo
*Lonely Mountains: Downhill* is one of my all time favorite games and played it
on my Switch when it was ported there. So I was really excited and hotly
anticipating the sequel when they announced it during the summer. I played as
much of this demo as I could the couple of days after it was released and I
*love* it. I think it builds perfectly on what they did in the first game and
they have the feel of riding through different types of snow down pat. The only
thing I am torn about with this game is if I should get it on Switch to live
with the first one or get it on Steam.

## Binged and haven't picked back up
- 140
- Lightyear Frontier
- Dorfromantik
- Mini Motorways

*140* was gifted to me by a coworker, it's a music/sound based platformer and I
was able to get thru at least the first half of the levels over one long work
week. I picked it up for one quick session after that and just haven't seriously
gone back to it. I enjoyed the parts of the game I played of it, but it just got
too hard and I took too long between sessions that I've lost the little bit of
skill I developed for it. *Lightyear Frontier* is a mech farming game where you
land on a planet and have build, do some exploring, and farming. I need to
follow the quests a bit more closely cause I would get a little lost doing
little maintenance tasks and then not have gotten anything done for a while and
feel a bit bored because I haven't progressed. *Dorfromantik* is a hex based
puzzle game where you build a rural landscape with little towns, farms, water,
and railroads. You're given bonuses for connecting tiles that are similar
together and will get little missions to build things like a 40 tiles forrest or
railroad that's 20 tiles long. It's simple enough that I was able to learn all
the basics very quickly and then would figure out little tricks for getting
bigger bonuses on my own as I played. Despite being turn based and easy to lay
down and pick back up, I don't like doing that because I tend to forget my plans
after putting it down for a day. *Mini Motorways* is a good follow-up to *Mini
Metro*. It usually takes me an attempt or two to beat a level but I am slowly
figuring smart placement and planning of the different features.

## One Very Good Session
- ColdRidge
- The Farmer Was Replaced
- Fields of Mistria
- Golden Lap
- Tiny Glade
- Thronefall
- Rusty's Retirement

*ColdRidge* was a game I got on a whim because of [this Aftermath
review](https://aftermath.site/coldridge-indie-steam-pc-4x-exploration). I only
recently got it, so I haven't had a chance to play it much, but the first
session was for 1 in game season and I really enjoyed it. *The Farmer Was
Replaced* is a programming farming game. You tell what the automated bots should
do by writing python-esq code for them to follow. It was a fun game to run, but
I was doing it on my steam deck with a keyboard which was just a bit too awkward
to get into. I have plans on installing it on one of my desktop computers and
getting deeper into it. *Fields of Mistria* was brought to my attention from
[this Polygon
review](https://www.polygon.com/review/444036/fields-of-mistria-review-pc-early-access)
and I was able to get it on sale. I haven't played many in-game days but so far
it's got the good bits of *Stardew Valley* in it. I'm actually hoping it's early
access nature will help me here in that things don't get so deep or complicated
that I get overwhelmed and end up not playing. *Golden Lap* is a race team
manager game by the same developers as *art of rally* and *Absolute Drift*. I
was a very bad manager my team lost every race it entered in that first session.
I think this'll have to be a game I dedicate a week to just play while traveling
for work to understand enough to get ok with. *Tiny Glade* is another [Aftermath
review](https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder)
purchase and I like this little sandbox games that don't really have any
"gameification" to them. You just get to build pretty little houses. I'll
probably end up using this as a sorta tool to make pictures for role-playing
games I run for my friends. *Thronefall* is a fun tower defense game where you
also get to control a single hero unit. I've been playing on the steam deck and
think the controls are pretty well suited but struggle at times with selecting
units quickly, it will definitely be better when I play with a mouse and
keyboard. I also thoroughly enjoy the art style and think that is one of the big
reasons I want to keep playing, it's simple enough to get all info across while
not getting to bland to look at for long periods. *Rusty's Retirement* is an
idle-farming game that is designed to just live on your desktop as you do other
things. I had it opened for a bit and got some decent upgrades and plots placed.
But it isn't super suited to the way I work on my desk and just would keep
forgetting about it or it would get in the way of some other work I was trying
to do.

## Enjoy but don't play that frequently
- Marvel Snap
- Pumped BMX+
- Stardew Valley
- Tents and Trees

I played a lot of *Marvel Snap* when it was released, mostly because it was what
my friends were playing and it was nice talking about it with them. I started
playing again with the introduction of the Alliances, but will only do like a
game or two a week. Similar problems I have with multiplayer shooters, where
everyone gets too sweaty and I just enjoy playing my non-optimal decks in the
low ranks. *Pumped BMX+* is a side scrolling platformer in the vein of *Trials*
where you have to beat a score or perform a trick to get enough points to go to
the next level. This is a nice game I can boot for a session when I really don't
want to have to do anything that requires too much energy. *Stardew Valley* is a
game I've had for ages but only really play multiplayer with my friends who are
much much more into it than me. I'll be the stay-at-farm husband who just does
all the boring chores while they get to go and talk to everyone and optimize
things that I don't understand. It's a really nice and relaxing way to play the
game while getting to hang out with them. *Tents and Trees* is a fun logic
puzzle game that's similar to a nonogram (without making a cool picture) that
I'll play on my phone when I remember I have it installed.
