## Pocket Casts - Playback 2024
I've used [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) since March of 2017. I've
been happy with what I use it for, though I don't use many of the "advanced"
features like the file uploads. I also was lifetime grandfathered into the plus
tier. I don't imagine I'll be switching off of it anytime because it gets the
job done for my use case. Though I do wish there were better historical stats
than what they display right now. 

### Top Podcasts (by listening time)
1. Remap Radio (foundation tier)
2. Nextlander (patron)
   - The Nextlander Podcast (flagship)
   - Weekly Ramblecast
   - Never Been A Better Podcast
3. Behind the Bastards
4. Shift+F1 (patron - show and media reviews)
5. Brad & Will Made a Tech Pod. (patron - show and patron eps)

### Other Stats
- 44 days, 14 hours, 10 mins
- Listening time went up 123% compared to 2023
- 95% completion rate (706/747)

## Other Important Podcasts
These shows release less frequently and I'm not working thru a backlog for them
so they didn't have a chance to be top 5, but each one of these is an instant
queue when a new episode is released.
- A More Civilized Age (patron - show and bonus)
- Not Another D&D Podcast (patron - show and the bonus)
- Our Fake History (patron - show and bonus)
- Spawnpoint (supporter)
- Worlds Beyond Number (patron - show and firesides)
- What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law

### Occasional / New Podcasts
"Homework" podcasts, I need to read or watch something before starting the
episode (sorta). I break this rule with *Shelved by Genre* for some of the works
I don't feel like reading. I only listen to the parts of *Decoding TV* that
pertain to what shows I'm watching and if they aren't covering a show I watch, I
skip the episode. I got thru "Gundam 79" with *Mobile Suit Breakdown* and then
just haven't made the time to continue the shows. Whenever I do that I will
bring back *Mobile Suit Breakdown* into my rotation.
- Shelved by Genre
- Decoding TV
- Mobile Suit Breakdown

These two shows are pretty new additions (*You Are Error* just started this
month) but I'm enjoying them and can foresee them sticking around.
- You Are Error
- Better Offline

## Personal Ranking
1. A More Civilized Age
2. Worlds Beyond Number
3. Remap Radio
4. Brad & Will Made a Tech Pod.
5. Not Another D&D Podcast
6. Shift+F1
7. Nextlander

Why a top 7? Because I can, and these are my true never miss podcasts. I will
move other shows around, but never do I have more than one episode of these
unlistened to (kinda). Quick recap of the other shows I listed above but didn't
make the top cutoff.

*Behind the Bastards* made my Pocket Casts Playback list because I listen to it
while driving for work. Mostly because I think this is the least niche / weird
one that I can subject my coworker too. I've been slowly working my way thru the
back catalog picking ones that sound interesting to me, I'm almost caught up and
will have "run out" of episodes. I don't know what I'm gonna do when that time
comes. *Our Fake History* and *What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law* are two
other shows that I'll play while driving. They will continue to serve that role.
I also listened to *Shelved by Genre* cover "Book of the New Sun" and will be
reading along with their "Wizard of Earthsea" coverage.

*Spawnpoint* is enjoyable but I just not top 7 enjoyable. I think *You Are
Error* has a good chance of becoming a work driving show, I really enjoyed the
first two episodes. *Better Offline* but is starting to feel a bit repetitive
with the AI coverage, especially combined with the newsletter. I'll see what the
next couple of months looks like.

### A More Civilized Age
I really enjoy the mix of actual analysis of Star Wars and just very silly bits
and jokes made on the show (really thinking of the "Bug vs Insect" debate about
aliens they have). Their recent diversion into the Thrawn trilogy got me to read
more than one book this year and I think that was enough to get me to continue
reading prose at a consistent rate. Having only listened to their Clone Wars
coverage (because I'd watched it a couple years prior), I'm really enjoying
watching along with Rebels and not knowing what will happen.

### Worlds Beyond Number
This show has become my running podcast. I will hold off on a new episode until
I am able to get out and it makes my runs fly by. Really enjoy the stories being
told, I struggled listening to other D&D podcasts before this and already
knowing everyone from Dimension 20 has made it easy to slip in and enjoy.

### Remap Radio
The continuation of Waypoint was a super easy sub for me and this is my primary
Video Game podcast. Though I'm probably only about 40% here for the games, their
tangents and non-game podcast eps are some of my favorite. Even though I said I
listen to every episode, I have kept a decent backlog of the "My Turn" episodes
because I want to watch the movies first.

### Brad & Will Made a Tech Pod.
I forget when / why I first picked up the show. It was definitely because of
following Brad from Giantbomb, but I don't know what finally got me to listen to
an episode. I wish I had listened to it early though, it instantly became one of
my favorite podcasts. I think they have the perfect mix of inquisitiveness and
knowledge to make for a fun show.

### Not Another D&D Podcast
YouTube has recommended me a [very early
episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx6JUr1sNg) of "D&D Court" with Aabria
and I got hooked. Soon after that I went and just listened to a bunch of the
non-campaign episodes until I caught up and just wanted more. I just picked up
Campaign 3 at episode 52 which was ever it was when I decided to listen and am
still excited 20 episodes later as the campaign ends. I subscribed to the
Patreon so I could get their bonus content which is a super easy one to keep up.

### Shift+F1
I had listened to this back in the Alt+F1 days and then fell off it as I got
busy with life and just wasn't following Formula 1 as much. On a whim I picked
it back up, even though I'm not watching week to week. This has become my
primary way of enjoying and keeping up with F1. I like the hosts personalities
and banter enough to keep subbed even during the off season.

### Nextlander
I probably listen the weirdest way to this podcast. For the main podcast I will
listen to everything but their coverage of what games they've been playing. I
treat this as just a "three dudes talking" podcast where I'm more interested in
their thoughts on the news and just random things they talk about. I'm more
excited when a "Ramblecast" or "Never Been A Better Podcast" drop than the main
one.
