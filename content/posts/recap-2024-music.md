## Spotify Wrapped
This year I listened to 59,369 mins of music. I don't use Spotify for audio
books or podcasts because that is dumb. I've been listening to less music
(Spotify is the only app I listen to music on) every year for the past 4 years.
A high in 2021 of 117,352 mins, followed by 88,938 and 78,971 mins in 2022 and
2023 respectively. I wanted to download all the data they had on me, but it only
went back to mid year (that I could figure out anyway). For once though I
thought their top artists and songs made some sense, usually they feel wildly
weighted toward the end of the year. Part of the reason my consumption has
dropped is that I stopped listening to music while driving for work, instead
putting on podcasts as they help keep me awake a bit easier.

### Top Artists
1. Polyphia
2. AURORA
3. Sonya Belousova
4. The Family Crest
5. Make Them Suffer

Fully agree with this, though *Sonya Belousova* is there because of the "One
Piece" soundtrack and *The Family Crest* is there because of the "Prelude to
War". Which I guess means I agree with 60% of the list.

#### 10 other artists I would include (in alphabetical order):
- Berlinist
- Broken Brass
- Juniper Vale
- Lucky Chops
- Phildel
- Sammus
- Sigrid
- The Longest Johns
- TheFatRat
- Tristam

My favorite artists are always ones I can at least put a couple of their albums
on, I don't necessarily love every album they put out (though, some I do love
everything). Recent artists I've just shuffled their discography (aka mostly
listening to Spotify's "This Is" playlist for them) include TheFatRat, Sigrid,
Juniper Vale, AURORA, Polyphia, Make Them Suffer, Approaching Nirvana, and
Nightwish. Approaching Nirvana and Nightwish I've been listening to for 15ish
years at this point and they've drifted into being just a low constant hum of
music, particularly for when I'm switching between music genre binges. Juniper
Vale, Sigrid, and AURORA are similar except I haven't been listening as long, I
think of them as "similar" artists and will usually listen to them together. 

#### Live Shows (aka MagFest)
I don't get a chance to go to a lot of live concerts. Working with a band I see
a lot of live music, just the same group every night. I was able to take a
vacation and go to MagFest 2024 early in the year. The weather cooperated and
there was bad snow so our gigs for that weekend were postponed which meant I got
to stay for the whole con. I was really excited about this because it meant I
got to see Sammus live which was very very cool! I stood in the front row for
the show and was really glad I got to see her. The last night we also saw The
Protomen which was another phenomenal show. I dragged my friends along to both
those shows and they were glad I did. While waiting for Sammus, we caught the
end of Bit Brigade's set which was a fun one. We stumbled into Super MadNES at
one point while waiting for something else. Even though I slept thru a good
chunk of their show (the con is very tiring) that was a fun one to sit and
watch. The last day we made it early enough for the Community Orchestra Concert
which was super cool! It made me really miss playing music.

### Top Songs
1. My Sails Are Set (from the Netflix Series "One Piece") - Sonya Belousova,
   Giona Ostinelli, AURORA
2. labour - Paris Paloma
3. I Will Wait - Mumford & Sons
4. Wolf - First Aid Kit
5. notre dame - Paris Paloma

I don't have any notes to add here; those were songs I listened to a lot, "I
Will Wait" might be the most shocking one, but otherwise the other 4 ended up
frequently in the auto generated playlists I would pick. I think looking at the
list below, a couple songs I found later in the year will probably end up
sticking around longer than these 5 like "The Northwest Passage" by The Longest
Johns and El Pony Pisador or "Blink 182" by Half an Orange. Also the songs by
artists I really like will just appear in those artist rotations. For example
"Ghost of Me" and "Doomswitch" being in the *Make Them Suffer* loop or "Some
Type Of Skin" in rotation for *AURORA*.

### Top Albums
I wish they'd also include albums in their wrapped too. I will occasionally put
on certain albums that I really like, but not that often. I am guilty of using
their auto generated playlists like the Artist Radio, the Daily Mixes, and their
Artist / Genre Mixes. 

#### Personal Top Albums (Don't actually know if they are the most listened to)
1. One Piece (Soundtrack from the Netflix Series) - Sonya Belousova, Giona
   Ostinelli, AURORA
2. How To Let Go - Sigrid
3. Brute Force - The Algorithm (floating point)
4. Happy But Still Sad - Juniper Vale
5. Remember That You Will Die - Polyphia

I really liked the "Zelda & Jazz II" album by The Deku Trio, GameChops, and
Unplugged. I believe it was a Polygon article the put me on to it. I've played
it a couple times while doing some computer work and it was excellent for that.
I also had a friend recommend one of the songs on "8" by Uneven Structure and I
ended up finding the whole album enjoyable.
