title = 'Reading Books Again'
+++

I've been reading the [*Thrawn* trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy) along with [A More Civilized Age](https://amorecivilizedage.net/) and have been really enjoying it. It's spurred me into reading again. I hadn't finished a prose book in over two and a half years and this year I'll have read 3 in the last three months. I hope I'm able to keep this up, even if it's not at this pace. Planning on reading [The Books of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Earthsea) after and follow along with [Shelved by Genre](https://rangedtouch.com/shelved-by-genre/) on that on. Making it homework seems to be helping right now.

I'm also trying to keep up with my comic books. I've been pulling and buying them but not staying on top of the pile. Alternating between reading them and reading prose has helped start making a dent, but I'm not consistent enough to make it meaningful.
